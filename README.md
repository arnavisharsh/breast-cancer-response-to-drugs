# breast-cancer-response-to-drugs

2 Words - Personalized Healthcare. With the future of healthcare expanding thanks to machine learning, I created this project to help learn and utilize these resources to take the first steps to enter the field of bioinformatics. Taking advantage of resources and data provided by GDSC, I used breast cancer cell line expression data and created a Logistic Regression Model to learn relationships between expression data and IC50 values in

## üß† About

The **goal** of this project was to help me take a dive into the world of bioinformatics with a hands on approach. I particularly chose this project since it allowed me to learn how to use new technologies to expand healthcare. I chose to tackle breast-cancer since it affects more than 2.3 million women worldwide (2022 VIA. WHO) and worries even more people who may see symptoms and wish to get some comfort. I made this project to learn the initial steps in helping provide personalized care by utilizing machine learning to determine relationships between breast cancer cells and IC50 values of drugs.
